Fix capital gains tax to work like spreadsheet
Change language of StockMarketYear to reflect domain better ('buy' and 'sell' rather than 'deposit' and 'withdraw')

Polish UI look & feel

---
UI thingies to investigate further:

Desktop
- Swing (MigLayout? JGoodies FormLayout? Macify?)
- SwiXml (layer on top of Swing)


---
Long term:

- More realistic abstraction for capital gains tax (in StockMarketYear)
