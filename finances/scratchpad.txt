Capital gains
Get rid of SavingAccountYear initializers
Clean up 

Fix primitive obsession
Make sure nextYear() is setting all variables properly  --  need to carry forward capital gains, for example
Calculate endingCapitalGains()

Consider what to do about withdrawing more than the starting balance  -- assert that this is impossible?
Fix SavingAccountYearTest.newAccount abstraction -- use it or don't!
We're passing in capitalGainsTaxRate everywhere -- put it in constructor?
Eliminate totalWithdrawnExceptCapitalGains()?
