'year' concept should be object?
fail fast in StockMarketTableModel.getValueAt() default case
Polish UI look & feel
fail fast in StockMarket.getYear() when request year is out of range
cumulative error due to truncating doubles into integers --fix it, it's too large

---			

Assert on TaxRate -- need to enforce legal values
Desk check - spreadsheet results compared to StockMarketYear results

UI thingies to investigate further:

Desktop
- Swing (MigLayout? JGoodies FormLayout? Macify?)
- SwiXml (layer on top of Swing)
